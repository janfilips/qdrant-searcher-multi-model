# Qdrant Hybrid Search

This project provides a set of examples demonstrating how to perform hybrid searches using the Qdrant vector search engine.

The system is designed to handle searches using dense embeddings, sparse embeddings, and late interaction models. It also supports advanced retrieval techniques such as Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine results from different models effectively.
