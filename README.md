# Qdrant Hybrid Search

This project is a hybrid search and retrieval system that leverages various embedding models alongside the Qdrant vector search engine.

The system can perform searches using dense embeddings, sparse embeddings, and late interaction models, supporting advanced retrieval techniques like Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine results from different models. Additionally, the project provides tools for creating and managing collections in Qdrant, mapping data, and inserting records into the search engine.
